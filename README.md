#100DaysOfCode

I will be starting Round 2 of 100 days of code. This round is going to be a little different. This round I want to focus more on a specific thing and do a deep dive into it. I am going to start by finishing my React Course, but then I am going to jump into JavaScript and keep that focus the rest of the way.

Goals:

-   Finish React Course
-   Spend a large portion of 100 days on JavaScript
-   I want to get into more complex parts of JavaScript
-   Build the confidence needed to apply for a new job
-   Work on my networking skills
-   Start to contribute to open source projects
-   Finish Book App (Want to get this finished, but it is last on the list for a reason)

Obstacles:

-   Video Games
-   Work
-   Family
-   Health

My Obstacles are still about the same. I am doing all of this to find a new job and get away from what I do now. I have had a lot of health issues over the last year or so. I have been in and out of the doctor, and it is to the point that we think that my job is the source of my problems. So that is an extra motivation for me to push through this and find a new job.

Day 1 (Christmas)

Tonight I got a lot more time than expected. I moved further into the course I have been working on, and spent some extra time learning about "this." I have to say that I do not fully understand the "this" keyword, but I will do some reading tonight while I lay in bed. I want to get a better grip on understanding it because I know it will be important when I get into more complex JavaScript stuff. Also, I got to the part of using React to pass state from the child to the parent component. I knew how to do this, but needed a refresher.

---

Day 2

Tonight again I was facing many computer issues. I did not shut my computer down last night, but I just left it in sleep mode. I have started to notice that when I skip the full shutdown process, I experience more issues. I worked on getting the API keys I would need for the course, and also getting the keys into a .env file. I ran into some issues getting that to work as expected, so I jumped on StackOverflow and got the problem solved. I hope to get a lot more time tomorrow night, and hopefully, my computer is up to the task. I think buying a new computer is going to be moved to the top of my todo list for the new year.

---

Day 3

Tonight after my first day back to work in a week I am a little under the weather. It was rainy and cold all day and going in and out into that weather really took its toll on me today. I will have to jump back into coding tomorrow night. I will also take up some time tomorrow on my lunch reading and watching videos to help make up for my loss of night.

---

Day 4

Tonight I thought my computer finally died. It took over 20 minutes to open safari, and then my computer would not reboot after shutting it down. I tried running safe mode and disk repair, but the results did not change. I ended up having to reinstall the OS. While that was installing, I got things set up on my laptop and hooked my MacBook air up to an extra monitor so I could code. I knocked out another section of the React course where it was going over axios and async-await. I have not used axios before, so this was something different, but also in a way felt familiar.

---

Day 5

So with my new setup of using my MB Air with an extra monitor and only running video from my iMac things seem to be running smoother. My iMac is not freezing nearly as much, but the problem is still there. This might be what I have to do until this spring when I give in and upgrade to a new computer. Today I spent more time in the React course and knocked out two more sections. Ran into some issues and like usual it was simple misspellings that caused all my problems. This was more of a styling portion to the course. The next section will be a more extensive recap section. Then after that, I think I might start JavaScript 30 by Wes Bos. Once I finish that hopefully, I will have a couple of ideas of things I want to build that are a little more complex than a ToDo list or weather app.

---

Day 6

Today was a day of rare form. A couple of days ago I started to do some FCC on JavaScript to get the feeling back. I also plan on jumping into JavaScript 30 to start the new year. Today I knocked out little over 20 challenges on FCC, and also knocked out a larget section of my React course. I feel excellent about how everything went today. I sent some goals and knocked them all out. I want to work on my book app tomorrow, but I also want to knock out more of the FCC challenges. I will try to find the right balance for those two. I want to get the basics of the book up done and learn how to deploy it. I know I have some challenges coming up, but I am excited to face them.

---

Day 7

Today was little of a downer day. I did a little over 20 of the FCC challenges, and have started a blog post. I want to do a blog post about my 1st 100 days of code challenge. I want to cover what went well, and also include things that did not go well and that I want to change for my round 2 challenge. I think this post will be mostly for a reminder for myself that way I know what habits to not fall back into.

---

Day 8

I spent the evening doing more of the FCC challenges. I only knocked out 10 to 15 of them. I wanted to get more done, but had a busy day at work and need to get a few things done around the house also. I did start sketching out an idea for how I want a new site to look. I think I am going to use the Star Wars API and create a React page around that. I also, think I might do the same thing with the Pokemon API. At first, I wanted to do two separate sites, but consider that maybe I can come up with a way to have them on the same site and a toggle between them. I am not 100% sure how that would work or how I could build it together, but that would be the challenge in the project. I hope tomorrow I will be able to knock out the rest of the section I am doing on FCC, then maybe either get the project started, or work more on my blog post.

---

Day 9

Tonight was a struggle for me because I am not feeling well. I know that coding every night is, so I fought through the "ugh" feelings and got to work. I finished off the Basics of JavaScript on FCC and felt pretty good about it. I did struggle with a couple of the challenges, and mainly the Record Collection one. I was confused about what I was being asked to accomplish. I did look at the hints to get me started after a few minutes. Once I got a better understanding of what I was being asked to do things went a lot better. I still struggled on that one the most, but in the end, I was able to make my way through the problem. I wanted to do more tonight, but I used up my all my coding time on FCC. I think this weekend I am going to jump into JavaScript 30 by Wes Bos and see what it is all about. I do not know if I will do it in 30 days, but I will check it out and set up a plan once I understand how it is set up.

---

Day 10

I started doing the JavaScript30 challenge tonight and knocked out the drum kit. It was not something that I got confused during, but it did feel good going over some JavaScript using the querySelector. I also started a React project for an old photo site mockup that I started and never finished. I think there is going to be a warm spell coming next week so I might take my laptop to work with me and do some coding on my lunch break in my car. I will have an API hooked to the photo site so I will see if using my phone as a hotspot will be good enough for it to work. I have been cutting my coding time a little short because I bought a new book and had been digging into it every night also. It is "Can't Hurt Me" by David Goggins.

---

Day 11

Tonight I didn't get a whole lot accomplished. I spent most of the night playing games with my daughter. I got my photo-site project setup. I got the files I thought I would need but didn't get a whole lot of code in them. I can get some stuff done in the morning before anyone gets out of bed. My coding time hinges on how late my daughter sleeps in and if I can convince her a nap is good. While she is awake, I am going to hit the ES6 portion of FCC, and I hope to get that knocked out.

---

Day 12

Today I worked on my photo-site for a while. I finished off the navbar and the header. I wanted to make the navbar sticky but did not get that hooked up just yet. I will hopefully get that done tomorrow along with several other parts of the site. I do not know if I will complete the project tomorrow, but I should be able to get a lot of time into it. I feel good about what I did today. I was taking things that I learned and apply them without having to refer to other code or look things up. I didn't get things put together on my first try, but I was able to troubleshoot where the issues are.

---

Day 13

Today I worked on FCC and completed the ES6 section. I was running into some issues and getting extremely confused. I started the section doing well, then things starting going on in the house, and distractions starting popping up. Even with all the distractions, I was still able to power through the challenges and knock them out. I wanted to get more done on the photo site today but ended up watching a movie and getting in some family time. In a couple of weeks, I will have the house to myself on the weekend, and I plan on to get a ton of coding done that weekend. I want to get myself setup into a good spot going into that weekend. Not sure what the plan is for tomorrow night, but I want to get more done on FCC and my lunch tomorrow I will brainstorm or lookup some different designs for the next section of the photo site.

---

Day 14

Tonight I coded, but I did not get anywhere. I had a couple of ideas when I was at work and was giving them a try. I wasn't able to get things to work as expected, but I did a lot of research and trial and error. I feel like I learned what doesn't work, but still working on what might work. I think that is the best thing about coding. I might not figure out how to do what I want, but trying different things that end up not working for whatever reason does not discourage me. When I do solve the problem, I like to take time to go over what was not working and find out why it was not working.

---

Day 15

I spent some time working on my photo site and getting another section put together. Didn't get it completely assembled and how I want, but I get a good portion of it done. I am not much of a design person, so it looks sketchy. I will knock out the rest of it tomorrow night, and hopefully, get started on the next section. I could not get one part working as I wanted, so I will research that on my lunch to see what the malfunction is.

---

Day 16

Tonight was just more design and building on my photo-site. I spend a lot of time changing colors and making small tweaks. I need to build everything out and get it working before making the small design tweaks. I will tweak something in one area then go to another area to change something. I cannot decide if I should jump into the more intensive section next to where I will be making the API call and doing all that fun stuff or if I should save that for last. I have multiple ideas of how I want the more labor intensive section to look so I am not sure what one to go with. So if I jump on the footer section next it could give me a little more time to figure out how I want everything to look.

---

Day 17

Tonight I took off from coding. There was a lot of stuff I wanted to do and get done, but due to some family stuff, I felt taking tonight off was best. My daughter was crying this morning after I left for work and told my wife that she misses me and feels like she never gets to see me or play with me. That kind of hurt because I cannot explain to her for her to understand why I am spending so much time on my computer and doing what I am doing. So tonight I took the night off, and we played, and tomorrow night I won't get on my computer until I put her down for bed.

---

Day 18

Tonight I spent some time being a dad again. I am starting to change up my routine a little bit, so my daughter gets to see me a little more and spend more time with me. My usual routine would be to come home and get on my computer until I have to get her dinner ready. I would let her play and color, and we would talk a little, but usually, it was her playing by herself. If my wife were home, I would disappear into another room and spend my time there until dinner was ready, then eat and go back to my computer. I need to find a better balance in what I am doing. So tonight I did some reading of Clean Code and did more work on my blog. I hope I can get it cleaned up and post it this weekend if people read it great if they don't read it great. I'm not comfortable with my writing skills yet, so if its a blog that is not seen by many that is fine with me.

---

Day 19

Today was a good day. I finished off my blog and planned on publishing it Sunday or Monday. I spent some time working on my photo-site and concluded that I did not currently like how my design was turning out. So after a couple of hours of working on it, I called it a day and went back to the drawing board of how I wanted it to look. I have a new look I want to go with, so I will start that up on Sunday. Overall even with the design change, I feel like I did some stuff and was successful today.

---

Day 20

Today has been incredibly frustrating. I know what I want to do, but getting it done has not been happening. I need to take a break from coding for the day and just read. So I am going to possibly be done coding for the day and off my computer. I still might jump on later to do stuff and try a couple of things, but I won't be spending hours looking to figure things out as I have been. I hope I can get a decent amount of reading done. I want to finish the book I have been reading, and then I can focus on Clean Code.

---

Day 21

Today went better than yesterday. I ended up changing the design to something that I could knock out. I'm not giving up on what I wanted to do, and I will find a way to build out a carousel in React. After I finish off the website, I am working on I plan on building out an entire project for an image carousel in React. That way I will have the components when needed for future projects. I spent today brainstorming ideas for things I can build in JS/React to help me improve my skills. I want to start with easier projects and then work my way to more difficult projects.

---

Day 22

Today I spent a lot of time reading different blogs about random things. I did spend some time looking up how to make the carousel that I want to make. I am looking to avoid using video tutorials now and moving towards reading blogs for information. Tomorrow night I will knock out the rest of the photo site I have been working on. A lot of the stuff I will have to do is going to be getting it mobile ready. As long as things go smoothly, I do not think it should take a lot of time, but a lot of times coding does not get smooth.

---

Day 23

Tonight I knocked out the desktop version of the photo-site. I keep going in and tweaking things and adjust colors. I have an issue of telling myself that it is done, and I need to move on to the next thing. I am not sure why I do this, but I think it has something to do with wanting things to be perfect because others will see it. I am not very confident in my skills as a developer and especially not confident in my design skills. So I spend way to much time trying to perfect things that work but have an issue of trying to move on. I know it is a growing pain and it will pass once I get a few more things finished and under my belt. It is also something that I know is an issue and I am working on.

---

Day 24

Today I am going to be reading Clean Code. I got the book, and I am going to dive into it tonight. I have goals for the weekend, and I didn't make a lot of extra time for reading. So tonight will be me, Clean Code, and a notebook for some notes. I am excited to get into this book and learn more and hopefully understand it well enough to apply it to my coding.

---

Day 25

Tonight I am not feeling well and decided I would do more reading of Clean Code.

---

Day 26

Today I finished off my mockup of a photography website. It feels good to finally get it finished off and looking close to as expected. It did not take me long to get the mobile-friendly code added. I did not expect it to take long, and for one of the few times in coding, I was right about time. I also spent the night reading more in Clean Code and taking notes. I am not far into the book, and I am already thinking about how I have done things in the past and how I could change them to be better. I did not get as much time coding as I wanted to yesterday. I am not sure what is going on, but for the last several days I have not been feeling well in the evenings. I have not changed much up in my normal routine, and I am doing better about eating better so hopefully, these issues pass.

---

Day 27

Today was a somewhat successful day. It started a little rough because of focus issues, but I was able to rein them in and get to work. I spent most of the afternoon working on my image slider. I read a Medium article about how to build one and set out to get it made. I was doing well, but ran into some snags, and had to refer back to the article to get the ship put back on the right path. My goal was to do it 100% without referring back to the article, but I ran into some issues that I couldn't solve at the time. I was able to fix most of my problems outside of a couple that I had to look up. I will be reading more Clean Code tonight and figuring out something as my next project. I do not have any significant ideas yet, but I want to build something out in JS to keep those skills fresh.

---

Day 28

I think my iMac is officially done. I am having issues logging in and cannot get past the login screen. I have been working on trying to fix it, but so far nothing is working. So tonight it looks like it will be a night of reading Clean Code and taking notes. The issues with my computer are starting to really get to me. I think I will have to just use my laptop and deal with it until I can get a new computer in a couple months. Hopefully I can get the iMac working so when I do get a new one I can get some of the stuff off of the old one.

---

Day 29

Today was no coding because I had to do a complete system wipe on my computer. I spent the night getting everything installed and setup again. I knew my computer was on the fritz, but still for some reason did not back up any of the templates that I had, or some of the React components that I built out. So on top of getting things installed about going again, I will have to redo all of my stuff that I should have saved. I cannot be upset that I lost those things because it's my fault for not saving them. I think once I get things finished and everything ready to go I will spend a night to build out the templates that I had. I will worry about the React components at a later time. So tomorrow will mark the beginning of a new day on my computer. I don't like missing nights of coding, but I know that reading Clean Code will help me out in the future, and make me a better coder.

---

Day 30

Today I worked on my FCC stuff. I had not been on FCC for a while, so it was good to get back into the curriculum. I did the Regular Expressions section, and I already feel like I should have taken better notes. I might go over parts of it again tomorrow to fill in some of the blanks I have in my notes. I am rereading the functions chapter in Clean Code to make sure I grasp what is going on fully also. I am still in a way feeling off with my computer getting wiped from the issues. I know this issue set me back a couple of steps, but in any journey, things are bound to happen and get in the way. I need to push past this obstacle and get back on track. I will spend some time brainstorming tomorrow at work on things to build. I know I need things that will push me further in JavaScript and with the design aspect of a website. I want to build out one or two more things before I redo my portfolio site entirely.

---

Day 31

Today has been a real struggle. I still am fighting the feeling of no motivation. I want to do more and get things done, but when I sit down to do it, I have no focus. My computer is working much better than it has been since I was forced to wipe it, and I think losing everything is still the cause of my issues. Today at work was crazy busy and cold, so I did not have much of a brainstorm of ideas for different projects. I did jump online and look for ideas, but none of them seemed to fit in on what I want to accomplish. I will make a better more specific search tomorrow before work and think about how to set up things up and what fundamentals I will need to make it work. I will spend more time tonight reading than I had set aside, but because I cut my coding time short, I will increase my reading to keep coding my focus.

---

Day 32

Tonight I spent time setting up some templates and getting things back to normal. I had all my API keys backed up on my laptop, and got them moved back to my iMac. I will continue reading Clean Code and call that a night. Not a whole lot of excitement, but I feel like I'm moving back to getting things back to normal.

---

Day 33

Today I spent time making API calls to different APIs using axios. I wanted to get more practice in with axios, so I created a small project to make calls to different APIs. I used that to help me better understand axios and also to practice with reading documentation. I feel good after what I got done in axios. I am starting to feel more comfortable with starting up a project and getting things built out. I am not sure if I will do some more reading tonight or if I will give reading the night off.

---

Day 34

Today I spent a lot of time looking into why I could not check to see if my checkbox was checked or unchecked with React. I am not sure what I was doing wrong or what was happening, but I needed to take a break from it and walk away. In my mind, this is something that should be simple and what I had I thought would work with regular JS but is not working in React. I will do more reading and research to see what the deal is. I think my issues were coming from it not being in State. I had not created State in that component so I think maybe that is the issue in the end. I will mess with it later tonight or tomorrow. Once I get that figured out it 'should' be smooth sailing on my project.

---

Day 35

I am taking tonight off from coding and reading Clean Code. I am not feeling well and with the weather we are about to get I want to make sure I get extra sleep to hopefully prevent getting sick.

---

Day 36

Tonight after a lot of fighting with it I got my checkbox to toggle state. I think of something that is easy and if it doesn't work right the first time I start to over think things. I believe that it must be super complicated, but after researching, I find out that it was simple. After I got the toggle done, I moved on to the API calls. I am making the call to both API's at the jump to have data to populate both sides of the site. I will include a search bar so you can search for something specific. I do not know if this is the right way to do it, but this way is working. After I complete this project, I will possibly reach out to someone that knows a lot more about React to see if they can do a code review. I want to make sure I am doing things the correct way. Ultimately I feel great about tonight, and I will start creating components tomorrow.

---

Day 37

I am posting this a little earlier than usual. I did get my search bar hooked up on my Star Wars and Pokemon site. I had some issues getting things to work as I wanted them to, but with reading the documentation and some trial and error I got it working. I plan on doing some of the design stuff next, and then from there, everything should be smooth sailing. I hope I do not run into any more errors, and if there are more, I find I hope I can knock them out quickly. I don't have a specific design in my head so that this part might take a little longer than usual. I will be coding more tonight, so maybe I will have a solid design idea by the time I get back on later.

---

Day 38

Tonight I am reading some more of Clean Code

---

Day 39

I spent tonight sketching up some ideas for my StarPoke site and some ideas for my porfolio. I also finished off writing up my blog post, and plan on posting it tomorrow.

---

Day 40-41-42

I didn't do much updating over this weekend. I did get a few things done but had a lot of stuff come up that kept me busy, and off the computer. I did a little design, but mainly my time was spent trying to understand how to get some specific things to work. I wanted to get my child component to update state on the parent component, and that would allow different things to be displayed. It took me a while, but I was successful and got everything working.

---

Day 43

Today I have to take time off from being on my computer. I smashed my finger at work today, and typing has been difficult and painful. I am going to read tonight and do some design research.

---

Day 44

I am not sure what day I am officially on because I haven't updated in a few days. Today I spent my time working on the star wars side of my app. I got everything completed on that, along with some bug fixes. I spent a little longer than I wanted on a few things, but overall it feels good to be moving on to the pokemon side. I am not much of a designer for a lot of stuff so the site doesn't look beautiful, but it functions as expected right now. To me as long as it works like expected, then I am good with it. I can always come back and change up the design part.

---

Day 45

I spent the night reading.

---

Day 46

I did not do a whole lot tonight. I have been fighting the flu lately and trying to battle through it. Not sure what is going on, but I have not been able to eat much lately and feeling terrible. I hope this feeling resolves itself soon. Tonight I got stuff set up to work on the Pokemon side of the app I am working on. Hope I can get a large piece of it completed tomorrow.

---

Day 47

Tonight I spent time working on an issue that I didn't know I was having on my StarPoke app. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why I couldn't get the map function to work and realized that I was not getting an array back I was getting an object returned. I looked at my response result multiple times, but for some reason, there was not a click in my head that should have been obvious. I guess some nights are just like that and there isn't much I can do about it. I feel like a lot of time was wasted on this issue, but I know I won't be having this issue again in the future.

---

Day 48

Tonight I am doing more reading in Clean Code. I am going back over a couple things to go over some of my notes that I decided to shorthand. Tomorrow night and Saturday I will complete my StarPoke site then move on to my new portfolio site.

---

Day 49

I am going to do some light reading tonight and get up early. I have my alarm set so I will be getting up early to knock out all the stuff I need to get done. I have a lot of work around the house I need to do, but also am going to finish off my StarPoke project. That will leave me Sunday to figure out my portfolio colors and design. It's going to be a big weekend, and next weekend hopefully will be even better.

---

Day 50

Today I was going to get the site I was working on mobile friendly, but I decided that I wanted to get some of my assets, and things ready to get my portfolio built. I got most of the stuff needed to get everything ready. I am starting to get excited about getting my portfolio built again. I got my color pallet figured out and my design setup. I have not decided if I will do it in basic HTML or if it will be built in React. I am leaning towards doing it in basic HTML over React, but I could change my mind before I start building.

---

Day 51

I wanted to get some coding in, but ended up spending the night playing with my daughter and doing the family stuff.

---
