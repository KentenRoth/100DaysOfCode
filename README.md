#100DaysOfCode

I will be starting Round 2 of 100 days of code. This round is going to be a little different. This round I want to focus more on a specific thing and do a deep dive into it. I am going to start by finishing my React Course, but then I am going to jump into JavaScript and keep that focus the rest of the way.

Goals:

-   Finish React Course
-   Spend a large portion of 100 days on JavaScript
-   I want to get into more complex parts of JavaScript
-   Build the confidence needed to apply for a new job
-   Work on my networking skills
-   Start to contribute to open source projects

Obstacles:

-   Video Games
-   Work
-   Family
-   Health

My Obstacles are still about the same. I am doing all of this to find a new job and get away from what I do now. I have had a lot of health issues over the last year or so. I have been in and out of the doctor, and it is to the point that we think that my job is the source of my problems. So that is an extra motivation for me to push through this and find a new job.
