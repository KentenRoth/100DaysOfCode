#100DaysOfCode

I will be starting Round 2 of 100 days of code. This round is going to be a little different. This round I want to focus more on a specific thing and do a deep dive into it. I am going to start by finishing my React Course, but then I am going to jump into JavaScript and keep that focus the rest of the way.

Goals:

-   Finish React Course
-   Spend a large portion of 100 days on JavaScript
-   I want to get into more complex parts of JavaScript
-   Build the confidence needed to apply for a new job
-   Work on my networking skills
-   Start to contribute to open source projects
-   Finish Book App (Want to get this finished, but it is last on the list for a reason)

Obstacles:

-   Video Games
-   Work
-   Family
-   Health

My Obstacles are still about the same. I am doing all of this to find a new job and get away from what I do now. I have had a lot of health issues over the last year or so. I have been in and out of the doctor, and it is to the point that we think that my job is the source of my problems. So that is an extra motivation for me to push through this and find a new job.

Day 1 (Christmas)

Tonight I got a lot more time than expected. I moved further into the course I have been working on, and spent some extra time learning about "this." I have to say that I do not fully understand the "this" keyword, but I will do some reading tonight while I lay in bed. I want to get a better grip on understanding it because I know it will be important when I get into more complex JavaScript stuff. Also, I got to the part of using React to pass state from the child to the parent component. I knew how to do this, but needed a refresher.

Day 2

Tonight again I was facing many computer issues. I did not shut my computer down last night, but I just left it in sleep mode. I have started to notice that when I skip the full shutdown process, I experience more issues. I worked on getting the API keys I would need for the course, and also getting the keys into a .env file. I ran into some issues getting that to work as expected, so I jumped on StackOverflow and got the problem solved. I hope to get a lot more time tomorrow night, and hopefully, my computer is up to the task. I think buying a new computer is going to be moved to the top of my todo list for the new year.

Day 3

Tonight after my first day back to work in a week I am a little under the weather. It was rainy and cold all day and going in and out into that weather really took its toll on me today. I will have to jump back into coding tomorrow night. I will also take up some time tomorrow on my lunch reading and watching videos to help make up for my loss of night.

Day 4

Tonight I thought my computer finally died. It took over 20 minutes to open safari, and then my computer would not reboot after shutting it down. I tried running safe mode and disk repair, but the results did not change. I ended up having to reinstall the OS. While that was installing, I got things set up on my laptop and hooked my MacBook air up to an extra monitor so I could code. I knocked out another section of the React course where it was going over axios and async-await. I have not used axios before, so this was something different, but also in a way felt familiar.

---

Day 5

So with my new setup of using my MB Air with an extra monitor and only running video from my iMac things seem to be running smoother. My iMac is not freezing nearly as much, but the problem is still there. This might be what I have to do until this spring when I give in and upgrade to a new computer. Today I spent more time in the React course and knocked out two more sections. Ran into some issues and like usual it was simple misspellings that caused all my problems. This was more of a styling portion to the course. The next section will be a more extensive recap section. Then after that, I think I might start JavaScript 30 by Wes Bos. Once I finish that hopefully, I will have a couple of ideas of things I want to build that are a little more complex than a ToDo list or weather app.

Day 6

Today was a day of rare form. A couple of days ago I started to do some FCC on JavaScript to get the feeling back. I also plan on jumping into JavaScript 30 to start the new year. Today I knocked out little over 20 challenges on FCC, and also knocked out a larget section of my React course. I feel excellent about how everything went today. I sent some goals and knocked them all out. I want to work on my book app tomorrow, but I also want to knock out more of the FCC challenges. I will try to find the right balance for those two. I want to get the basics of the book up done and learn how to deploy it. I know I have some challenges coming up, but I am excited to face them.

---

Day 7

Today was little of a downer day. I did a little over 20 of the FCC challenges, and have started a blog post. I want to do a blog post about my 1st 100 days of code challenge. I want to cover what went well, and also include things that did not go well and that I want to change for my round 2 challenge. I think this post will be mostly for a reminder for myself that way I know what habits to not fall back into.

---

Day 8

I spent the evening doing more of the FCC challenges. I only knocked out 10 to 15 of them. I wanted to get more done, but had a busy day at work and need to get a few things done around the house also. I did start sketching out an idea for how I want a new site to look. I think I am going to use the Star Wars API and create a React page around that. I also, think I might do the same thing with the Pokemon API. At first, I wanted to do two separate sites, but consider that maybe I can come up with a way to have them on the same site and a toggle between them. I am not 100% sure how that would work or how I could build it together, but that would be the challenge in the project. I hope tomorrow I will be able to knock out the rest of the section I am doing on FCC, then maybe either get the project started, or work more on my blog post.

Day 9

Tonight was a struggle for me because I am not feeling well. I know that coding every night is, so I fought through the "ugh" feelings and got to work. I finished off the Basics of JavaScript on FCC and felt pretty good about it. I did struggle with a couple of the challenges, and mainly the Record Collection one. I was confused about what I was being asked to accomplish. I did look at the hints to get me started after a few minutes. Once I got a better understanding of what I was being asked to do things went a lot better. I still struggled on that one the most, but in the end, I was able to make my way through the problem. I wanted to do more tonight, but I used up my all my coding time on FCC. I think this weekend I am going to jump into JavaScript 30 by Wes Bos and see what it is all about. I do not know if I will do it in 30 days, but I will check it out and set up a plan once I understand how it is set up.

Day 10

I started doing the JavaScript30 challenge tonight and knocked out the drum kit. It was not something that I got confused during, but it did feel good going over some JavaScript using the querySelector. I also started a React project for an old photo site mockup that I started and never finished. I think there is going to be a warm spell coming next week so I might take my laptop to work with me and do some coding on my lunch break in my car. I will have an API hooked to the photo site so I will see if using my phone as a hotspot will be good enough for it to work. I have been cutting my coding time a little short because I bought a new book and had been digging into it every night also. It is "Can't Hurt Me" by David Goggins.

Day 11

Tonight I didn't get a whole lot accomplished. I spent most of the night playing games with my daughter. I got my photo-site project setup. I got the files I thought I would need but didn't get a whole lot of code in them. I can get some stuff done in the morning before anyone gets out of bed. My coding time hinges on how late my daughter sleeps in and if I can convince her a nap is good. While she is awake, I am going to hit the ES6 portion of FCC, and I hope to get that knocked out.

---

Day 12

Today I worked on my photo-site for a while. I finished off the navbar and the header. I wanted to make the navbar sticky but did not get that hooked up just yet. I will hopefully get that done tomorrow along with several other parts of the site. I do not know if I will complete the project tomorrow, but I should be able to get a lot of time into it. I feel good about what I did today. I was taking things that I learned and apply them without having to refer to other code or look things up. I didn't get things put together on my first try, but I was able to troubleshoot where the issues are.

---

Day 13

Today I worked on FCC and completed the ES6 section. I was running into some issues and getting extremely confused. I started the section doing well, then things starting going on in the house, and distractions starting popping up. Even with all the distractions, I was still able to power through the challenges and knock them out. I wanted to get more done on the photo site today but ended up watching a movie and getting in some family time. In a couple of weeks, I will have the house to myself on the weekend, and I plan on to get a ton of coding done that weekend. I want to get myself setup into a good spot going into that weekend. Not sure what the plan is for tomorrow night, but I want to get more done on FCC and my lunch tomorrow I will brainstorm or lookup some different designs for the next section of the photo site.

---

Day 14

Tonight I coded, but I did not get anywhere. I had a couple of ideas when I was at work and was giving them a try. I wasn't able to get things to work as expected, but I did a lot of research and trial and error. I feel like I learned what doesn't work, but still working on what might work. I think that is the best thing about coding. I might not figure out how to do what I want, but trying different things that end up not working for whatever reason does not discourage me. When I do solve the problem, I like to take time to go over what was not working and find out why it was not working.

---

Day 15

I spent some time working on my photo site and getting another section put together. Didn't get it completely assembled and how I want, but I get a good portion of it done. I am not much of a design person, so it looks sketchy. I will knock out the rest of it tomorrow night, and hopefully, get started on the next section. I could not get one part working as I wanted, so I will research that on my lunch to see what the malfunction is.
