#100DaysOfCode

I will be starting Round 2 of 100 days of code. This round is going to be a little different. This round I want to focus more on a specific thing and do a deep dive into it. I am going to start by finishing my React Course, but then I am going to jump into JavaScript and keep that focus the rest of the way.

Goals:

-   Finish React Course
-   Spend a large portion of 100 days on JavaScript
-   I want to get into more complex parts of JavaScript
-   Build the confidence needed to apply for a new job
-   Work on my networking skills
-   Start to contribute to open source projects
-   Finish Book App (Want to get this finished, but it is last on the list for a reason)

Obstacles:

-   Video Games
-   Work
-   Family
-   Health

My Obstacles are still about the same. I am doing all of this to find a new job and get away from what I do now. I have had a lot of health issues over the last year or so. I have been in and out of the doctor, and it is to the point that we think that my job is the source of my problems. So that is an extra motivation for me to push through this and find a new job.

Day 1 (Christmas)

Tonight I got a lot more time than expected. I moved further into the course I have been working on, and spent some extra time learning about "this." I have to say that I do not fully understand the "this" keyword, but I will do some reading tonight while I lay in bed. I want to get a better grip on understanding it because I know it will be important when I get into more complex JavaScript stuff. Also, I got to the part of using React to pass state from the child to the parent component. I knew how to do this, but needed a refresher.

Day 2

Tonight again I was facing many computer issues. I did not shut my computer down last night, but I just left it in sleep mode. I have started to notice that when I skip the full shutdown process, I experience more issues. I worked on getting the API keys I would need for the course, and also getting the keys into a .env file. I ran into some issues getting that to work as expected, so I jumped on StackOverflow and got the problem solved. I hope to get a lot more time tomorrow night, and hopefully, my computer is up to the task. I think buying a new computer is going to be moved to the top of my todo list for the new year.

Day 3

Tonight after my first day back to work in a week I am a little under the weather. It was rainy and cold all day and going in and out into that weather really took its toll on me today. I will have to jump back into coding tomorrow night. I will also take up some time tomorrow on my lunch reading and watching videos to help make up for my loss of night.

Day 4

Tonight I thought my computer finally died. It took over 20 minutes to open safari, and then my computer would not reboot after shutting it down. I tried running safe mode and disk repair, but the results did not change. I ended up having to reinstall the OS. While that was installing, I got things set up on my laptop and hooked my MacBook air up to an extra monitor so I could code. I knocked out another section of the React course where it was going over axios and async-await. I have not used axios before, so this was something different, but also in a way felt familiar.

Day 5

So with my new setup of using my MB Air with an extra monitor and only running video from my iMac things seem to be running smoother. My iMac is not freezing nearly as much, but the problem is still there. This might be what I have to do until this spring when I give in and upgrade to a new computer. Today I spent more time in the React course and knocked out two more sections. Ran into some issues and like usual it was simple misspellings that caused all my problems. This was more of a styling portion to the course. The next section will be a more extensive recap section. Then after that, I think I might start JavaScript 30 by Wes Bos. Once I finish that hopefully, I will have a couple of ideas of things I want to build that are a little more complex than a ToDo list or weather app.

Day 6

Today was a day of rare form. A couple of days ago I started to do some FCC on JavaScript to get the feeling back. I also plan on jumping into JavaScript 30 to start the new year. Today I knocked out little over 20 challenges on FCC, and also knocked out a larget section of my React course. I feel excellent about how everything went today. I sent some goals and knocked them all out. I want to work on my book app tomorrow, but I also want to knock out more of the FCC challenges. I will try to find the right balance for those two. I want to get the basics of the book up done and learn how to deploy it. I know I have some challenges coming up, but I am excited to face them.
