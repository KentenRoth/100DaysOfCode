# 100DaysOfCode

This repo will be used to keep track of my progress during my 100 days of code journey.  I want to continue learning to code and also use this to help me hold my self accountable.  I know I will miss days along the way due to things coming up or happening.  I want to use this journey to help improve my chances of finally changing into a career that I enjoy.

Goals:
- Learn NodeJS
- Learn MongoDB
- Learn SQL
- Improve my JS knowledge

Obstacles:
- Video Games
- Work
- Family

Day 1 

I spent a lot of time looking over NodeJS, MongoDB and SQL to see what one I wanted to tackle first.  I settled on a NodeJS and got everything ready to go for it.  I purchased a Udemy Course that has NodeJS and MongoDB in the same course, and also picked up a course on mySQL.  I am excited to get started, and hopefully I can get more time in later tonight.

Day 2

So I have to admit that I feel slightly overwhelmed.  I know there is a vast amount of libraries and help for learning NodeJS, but at the start it seems a bit heavy.  I think this feeling will go away once I get more into the language and I see how things start fitting together.  I spent some time on the require function and I see how/why it is used, but I think finding the right library to use and understanding the documentation for them is what is getting me.  I will start looking at a random library or NodeJS api on my lunch at work and read the documentation.  That should help me learn a little better, and hopefully knock the edge off of feeling like this is a big bite and hard to chew.

Day 3

Today feels much better.  I got to use a 3rd party library and go around its documentation to see what it can do.  There is a lot of stuff that it can do that I doubt I will use, but there are features in it that seem nice.  Also, got it installed inside the package.json file so it can be used.  Also, learned that if it is showing in your package.json file that you can delete the main folder before uploading it or sending it to someone.  If someone wants to use the program they just need to run NPM install while in the folder and it will get everything they need.

Day 4

Today was a disappointing day.  I felt good this AM when I got up for work, but by the time I made it threw the day and finally got home and able to get on my computer I was completely exhausted.  I only got about 30-45 minutes in and I feel like I am going to have to go over most if not all of it again tomorrow.  I knew days would be like this from time to time with work and having to work longer days from time to time.  I have more time cut out tomorrow for coding so I will hit it hard and redeem myself.
