# 100DaysOfCode

I apologize for spelling and grammer issues.  For some reason Grammarly is not working with github.

This repo will be used to keep track of my progress during my 100 days of code journey.  I want to continue learning to code and also use this to help me hold my self accountable.  I know I will miss days along the way due to things coming up or happening.  I want to use this journey to help improve my chances of finally changing into a career that I enjoy.

Goals:
- Learn NodeJS
- Learn MongoDB
- Learn SQL
- Improve my JS knowledge

Obstacles:
- Video Games
- Work
- Family

Day 1 

I spent a lot of time looking over NodeJS, MongoDB and SQL to see what one I wanted to tackle first.  I settled on a NodeJS and got everything ready to go for it.  I purchased a Udemy Course that has NodeJS and MongoDB in the same course, and also picked up a course on mySQL.  I am excited to get started, and hopefully I can get more time in later tonight.

Day 2

So I have to admit that I feel slightly overwhelmed.  I know there is a vast amount of libraries and help for learning NodeJS, but at the start it seems a bit heavy.  I think this feeling will go away once I get more into the language and I see how things start fitting together.  I spent some time on the require function and I see how/why it is used, but I think finding the right library to use and understanding the documentation for them is what is getting me.  I will start looking at a random library or NodeJS api on my lunch at work and read the documentation.  That should help me learn a little better, and hopefully knock the edge off of feeling like this is a big bite and hard to chew.

Day 3

Today feels much better.  I got to use a 3rd party library and go around its documentation to see what it can do.  There is a lot of stuff that it can do that I doubt I will use, but there are features in it that seem nice.  Also, got it installed inside the package.json file so it can be used.  Also, learned that if it is showing in your package.json file that you can delete the main folder before uploading it or sending it to someone.  If someone wants to use the program they just need to run NPM install while in the folder and it will get everything they need.

Day 4

Today was a disappointing day.  I felt good this AM when I got up for work, but by the time I made it threw the day and finally got home and able to get on my computer I was completely exhausted.  I only got about 30-45 minutes in and I feel like I am going to have to go over most if not all of it again tomorrow.  I knew days would be like this from time to time with work and having to work longer days from time to time.  I have more time cut out tomorrow for coding so I will hit it hard and redeem myself.

---

Day 5

Today was a much better day.  I spent sometime at work going over the stuff I did last night to do a bit of a refresher.  I was feeling better about what I did yesterday because of that, and started to dive a little deeper into NodeJS.  I learned more about using process.argv and about the yargs library.  I did run into some errors, but I worked threw them using what was provided by the terminal.  I was able to debug a little and find my mistakes without having to google something or look for answers on stack overflow.  It's the little wins that I have to take when I am early in learning a language so I keep that overwhelmed feeling away, and it helps me realize that I am starting to understand this coding stuff.

Day 6

Tonight I continued on with the course I have learning NodeJS.  I spent time learning about JSON and how to parse the data it returns.  This area of the course is starting to feel better because I know the basics of JavaScript.  I am starting to feel really good about how things are put together.

---

Day 7

Today was cut very short due to a headache.  It's not to often that I get a headache so I'm struggling with fighting threw it.  I did do a couple challenges in my NodeJS course, and completed them succesfully.  I had to filter a couple arrays and setup a remove note function.  The app that I am building in the course is a note taking app.  Tomorrow I plan on getting an early start to coding.  I had a specific goal in mind for the weekend and I still plan on hitting that mark.

---

Day 8

Today went well.  I powered threw some challenges.  One took a lot longer than it should have because I spaced of on some simple things.  I most likely could have solved it much faster if I would have jumped on google and looked up the issue, but I feel like learning is done better when I try and fail vs having the answer handed to me.  There are plenty of times that I will google something, but this challenge should not have been that difficult so I wanted to find my own mistake and correct it.

---

Day 9

Today I moved into Asynchronous basics.  I completed the basics with learning how to build a note taking app and this is the next step in the course.  I still feel pretty good about how this is going because of knowing the basics of JavaScript.  Tonight got cut a little shorter in time than I thought it would, but I feel like I found a decent stopping point and will jump back in tomorrow night.  I have a 3 day weekend so I am excited to get to the weekend and really hit coding hard.  I want to be completed and understand the async portion of this course by the time I call it a night on Friday.

---

Day 10

Today was spent on doing calls to APIs and learning callbacks.  I also did some error handling and got the location part of the weather app working.  By type in an address now it will pull the lng and lat by getting the information from the mapquest API.  I am still feeling really good about how everything is going with learning NodeJS.  I am excited to push forward and get deeping into what NodeJS can offer.

Day 11

I did not get to code tonight because my daughter has been sick.  Hope she is better tomorrow!!

---

Day 12

Back to back days I wasnt able to code because of my daughter being sick.  She is starting to feel better and starting to act a little more normal so I think all should be good.  I am off work tomorrow and will have the house to myself so I will be getting in extra hours coding.  

---

Day 13

Today went a lot better than the last two days.  I didn't get as far as I wanted, but I am happy with what I did get done today.  I should have the house to myself tomorrow afternoon for a while so I should be able to get in a little more coding that I normally would.  I'm excited to learn more about promises and getting the pieces together on how to deploy a node app.

---

Day 14

Finished off the weather app that was in the course I am doing.  I have moved on to now learning express and how to get everything running outside of the terminal.  I want to do more with the weather app and try some things out.  I think I will start working on some sort of project that will be like the weather app with more features so I can practice making api calls and using promises.  I also, might upload that to this github repo also.  Not sure how I want to do it for sure.

---

Day 15

Today in the course was spent on using github and how to deploy things to Heroku.  Wasn't a lot of hands on coding going on, but there was a lot of useful information.  I have not used heroku before, so it was good to see how deploying the apps is done.  The next thing in the course is learning how to test apps then it is on to MongoDB.  I might take a few days to work on the weather app to add some more features.  I want to get to MongoDB, but I don't want to rush what I am doing I want to make sure I'm retaining the information that is here.

---

Day 16

Today I have come down with a fever and started to get sick.  I wont code tonight and I will be in bed early.  I thought I was in the clear after I went a couple days after my daughter got sick, but today it got me.  I'll take some meds get some extra rest and be back at it tomorrow.  Yesterday I ended up getting everything setup and pushed to github to build out the weather app on my own.  I'll watch some videos as refreshers on my lunch break at work and then see if I can get it built out by myself.
