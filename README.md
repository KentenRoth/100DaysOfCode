# 100DaysOfCode

I apologize for spelling and grammer issues.  For some reason Grammarly is not working with github.

This repo will be used to keep track of my progress during my 100 days of code journey.  I want to continue learning to code and also use this to help me hold my self accountable.  I know I will miss days along the way due to things coming up or happening.  I want to use this journey to help improve my chances of finally changing into a career that I enjoy.

Goals:
- Learn NodeJS
- Learn MongoDB
- Learn SQL
- Improve my JS knowledge

Obstacles:
- Video Games
- Work
- Family

Day 1 

I spent a lot of time looking over NodeJS, MongoDB and SQL to see what one I wanted to tackle first.  I settled on a NodeJS and got everything ready to go for it.  I purchased a Udemy Course that has NodeJS and MongoDB in the same course, and also picked up a course on mySQL.  I am excited to get started, and hopefully I can get more time in later tonight.

Day 2

So I have to admit that I feel slightly overwhelmed.  I know there is a vast amount of libraries and help for learning NodeJS, but at the start it seems a bit heavy.  I think this feeling will go away once I get more into the language and I see how things start fitting together.  I spent some time on the require function and I see how/why it is used, but I think finding the right library to use and understanding the documentation for them is what is getting me.  I will start looking at a random library or NodeJS api on my lunch at work and read the documentation.  That should help me learn a little better, and hopefully knock the edge off of feeling like this is a big bite and hard to chew.

---

Day 3

Today feels much better.  I got to use a 3rd party library and go around its documentation to see what it can do.  There is a lot of stuff that it can do that I doubt I will use, but there are features in it that seem nice.  Also, got it installed inside the package.json file so it can be used.  Also, learned that if it is showing in your package.json file that you can delete the main folder before uploading it or sending it to someone.  If someone wants to use the program they just need to run NPM install while in the folder and it will get everything they need.  

---

Day 4

Today was a disappointing day.  I felt good this AM when I got up for work, but by the time I made it threw the day and finally got home and able to get on my computer I was completely exhausted.  I only got about 30-45 minutes in and I feel like I am going to have to go over most if not all of it again tomorrow.  I knew days would be like this from time to time with work and having to work longer days from time to time.  I have more time cut out tomorrow for coding so I will hit it hard and redeem myself.

---

Day 5

Today was a much better day.  I spent sometime at work going over the stuff I did last night to do a bit of a refresher.  I was feeling better about what I did yesterday because of that, and started to dive a little deeper into NodeJS.  I learned more about using process.argv and about the yargs library.  I did run into some errors, but I worked threw them using what was provided by the terminal.  I was able to debug a little and find my mistakes without having to google something or look for answers on stack overflow.  It's the little wins that I have to take when I am early in learning a language so I keep that overwhelmed feeling away, and it helps me realize that I am starting to understand this coding stuff.

---

Day 6

Tonight I continued on with the course I have learning NodeJS.  I spent time learning about JSON and how to parse the data it returns.  This area of the course is starting to feel better because I know the basics of JavaScript.  I am starting to feel really good about how things are put together.

---

Day 7

Today was cut very short due to a headache.  It's not to often that I get a headache so I'm struggling with fighting threw it.  I did do a couple challenges in my NodeJS course, and completed them succesfully.  I had to filter a couple arrays and setup a remove note function.  The app that I am building in the course is a note taking app.  Tomorrow I plan on getting an early start to coding.  I had a specific goal in mind for the weekend and I still plan on hitting that mark.

---

Day 8

Today went well.  I powered threw some challenges.  One took a lot longer than it should have because I spaced of on some simple things.  I most likely could have solved it much faster if I would have jumped on google and looked up the issue, but I feel like learning is done better when I try and fail vs having the answer handed to me.  There are plenty of times that I will google something, but this challenge should not have been that difficult so I wanted to find my own mistake and correct it.

---

Day 9

Today I moved into Asynchronous basics.  I completed the basics with learning how to build a note taking app and this is the next step in the course.  I still feel pretty good about how this is going because of knowing the basics of JavaScript.  Tonight got cut a little shorter in time than I thought it would, but I feel like I found a decent stopping point and will jump back in tomorrow night.  I have a 3 day weekend so I am excited to get to the weekend and really hit coding hard.  I want to be completed and understand the async portion of this course by the time I call it a night on Friday.

---

Day 10

Today was spent on doing calls to APIs and learning callbacks.  I also did some error handling and got the location part of the weather app working.  By type in an address now it will pull the lng and lat by getting the information from the mapquest API.  I am still feeling really good about how everything is going with learning NodeJS.  I am excited to push forward and get deeping into what NodeJS can offer.

---

Day 11

I did not get to code tonight because my daughter has been sick.  Hope she is better tomorrow!!

---

Day 12

Back to back days I wasnt able to code because of my daughter being sick.  She is starting to feel better and starting to act a little more normal so I think all should be good.  I am off work tomorrow and will have the house to myself so I will be getting in extra hours coding.  

---

Day 13

Today went a lot better than the last two days.  I didn't get as far as I wanted, but I am happy with what I did get done today.  I should have the house to myself tomorrow afternoon for a while so I should be able to get in a little more coding that I normally would.  I'm excited to learn more about promises and getting the pieces together on how to deploy a node app.

---

Day 14

Finished off the weather app that was in the course I am doing.  I have moved on to now learning express and how to get everything running outside of the terminal.  I want to do more with the weather app and try some things out.  I think I will start working on some sort of project that will be like the weather app with more features so I can practice making api calls and using promises.  I also, might upload that to this github repo also.  Not sure how I want to do it for sure.

---

Day 15

Today in the course was spent on using github and how to deploy things to Heroku.  Wasn't a lot of hands on coding going on, but there was a lot of useful information.  I have not used heroku before, so it was good to see how deploying the apps is done.  The next thing in the course is learning how to test apps then it is on to MongoDB.  I might take a few days to work on the weather app to add some more features.  I want to get to MongoDB, but I don't want to rush what I am doing I want to make sure I'm retaining the information that is here.

---

Day 16

Today I have come down with a fever and started to get sick.  I wont code tonight and I will be in bed early.  I thought I was in the clear after I went a couple days after my daughter got sick, but today it got me.  I'll take some meds get some extra rest and be back at it tomorrow.  Yesterday I ended up getting everything setup and pushed to github to build out the weather app on my own.  I'll watch some videos as refreshers on my lunch break at work and then see if I can get it built out by myself.

---

Day 17

Still not feeling the best, but I did get some time in to code.  I decided to work a little on my weather app tonight.  I got the api hooked up to pull the lat and lng from mapquest.  I have it pushed up to github and tomorrow I will start working on the rest.  I wanted to do more tonight, but I need to get some more sleep to hopefully fully beat this sickness.

---

Day 18

Today I got a little coding in on my lunch break from work and then a little more coding done in the evening.  I hooked up the weather part of the weather app.  This is the part that pulls from the dark sky api by using the lat and lng from mapquest.  Next I want to figure out how to get the forcast for the next few days.  I am not 100% sure how to do that but that will be the next part of my project.  I also, am ready to get started on the testing portion of the course.  I have seen a lot of stuff about testing but do not know anything about it or how to set it up.

---

Day 19

Today was just a lot of frustration and I think I need to walk away from the computer for a little while.  I have spent a decent amount of time trying to figure out how to loop over the resutls coming back from my forcast to get all 7 days and I cannot get it to work correctly.  I really dont see what I am missing right now and its extremely frustrating.  I feel like this is something that I should be able to code up without an issue, but for some reason something is off and just is not clicking right now.  

---

Day 20

Due to storms in the area I was not able to get in much time for code.  I did spend time on my phone looking at different open source things.  I want to get into doing open source once I get more comfortable with coding, so I spent time looking at how all that works.  Still not really sure I got the full grasp on how to do it, but once I get a little more coding under my belt (around the end of this 100 days) I want to start contributing to open source projects.  I think that will help me build on what I know and also help me when I start applying for a new job.

---

Day 21

Almost forgot to update this repo today.  I spent more time working on getting the weather app to do what I want, but still did not get it working right.  I feel better about what I did even though it is not working.  Also, spent more time making API calls to different APIs to help burn into the brain of how it is done without refering to code.  Then I spent some time watching videos on open source and I'm starting to think that it is a little farther out of my skill level than I realized.  I would still like to partake in open source, but it might be a little farther down the line.  Tomorrow I think I am going to jump over the testing part and get everything to learn mongoDB setup.  I will come back to testing once I finish off the course.  I want to have a couple different projects to apply testing to so that is my reasoning for coming back to it later.

---

Day 22

Today was very uneventful.  I got everything setup for MongoDB and got everything running.  It took a little longer that I wanted it to, but I got it done.  Also, spen a little more time looking into my issue with my weather app and still could not get it going as expected.  I think I am offically calling it quits on that silly issue and move one then come back to it at a later time.  Tomorrow I will be ready to go fully into Mongo and learn how that works.

---

Day 23

Today I did not get much time to put into coding.  I only got about 30-45 minutes.  I had more time set aside, but my mouse was dead when I when to jump on and code so I had to get some life pushed back into it before I could get started.  Not really sure how it happened because I do not remember getting a notification yesterday saying the mouse battery was low and I do not remember the widget at the top coming up showing a low mouse battery.  They might have been there but I do not recall.  Not a whole lot I can do about it now other than charge it the rest of the way over night and get back at it tomorrow.  I have a larger chunk of time set aside to code tomorrow.

---

Day 24

Today was cut a little short due to stoms again.  It has been raining on a daily basis the last couple weeks.  I usually shut everything down during major storms so once again that is what I will have to do tonight.  I got started with MongoDB and really want to keep going, but the weather wont let me.  Tomorrow I only work half a day so I will use that extra time to get more done.

---

Day 25

Today was a very good day.  I am really getting into MongoDB and enjoying it.  I have had a project idea for a while and from what I am learning right now I can really see how I could get this project put together from start to finish.  I am not sure how the UI will look or how I would design it, but knowing how the database part would work and look and how to connect to it is really making it feel like this project will be something I could work on from start to finish a lot sooner.  Hopefully I can also add a login and database to my simple garden app that I built as practice before I dive into the deep end of the larger project I want to build that I would share with my family and friends.

---

Day 26

I did not code much tonight.  I am extremely tired from work and getting up earlier than normal.  I did get some time in, but it didn't feel like enough.  I have also started to notice that my computer is bogging down with the mongo stuff I have been doing.  I have 2 terminal windows open, udemy video playing, robo t3, and VS code and there are moments that my computer just stops for a couple seconds before it kicks back in.  I know my iMac is old (mid 2011) but I was really wanting to push off getting a new one until I finally got a new job.

---

Day 27

Today went well, and I got in a decent amount of time for coding.  I hope tomorrow that I can get more time in, but we are having my daughters birthday party.  I am still really feeling good about mongoDB and part of me wants to jump ahead and start on a couple projects for it.  I have to keep convincing myself to not do that and to take my time to make sure I know what is going on before I jump off learning and hitting a project hard myself.
